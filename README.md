# mpp-serialization
Playing around with mpp serialization


I wanted to make a toy project that is all Kotlin client/server, and shares as much common code as possible. So far this has fallen over at the stage where I've tried to introduce
a typesafe JsClient for use with KotlinXSerialization.

When I run the Gradle task "Run", and then go to localhost:8080 an error is logged out in the console, this is far as I've got.
